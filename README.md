The **New Year Countdown** is a simple yet elegant web app that displays the **remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds** until the **next New Year**.  
It’s built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring a smooth **loading animation** and automatic **year updates**.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. The script calculates the time difference between the **current date** and **January 1st of the upcoming year**.  
2. It updates the displayed **days, hours, minutes, and seconds** every second.  
3. When the countdown reaches zero, it seamlessly updates to start counting down to the next year.  
4. The spinner is shown briefly for a smooth user experience.
