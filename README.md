🎆 New Year Countdown 🎉


✨ A live countdown to welcome the New Year ✨

🕒 About the Project

The New Year Countdown is a simple yet elegant web app that displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the next New Year.
It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a smooth loading animation and automatic year updates.

🚀 Features

🗓️ Automatically targets the next New Year

💫 Loading spinner before countdown display

🌈 Clean and responsive UI

🔁 Auto refresh for new year transition

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Countdown functionality

🧠 How It Works

The script calculates the time difference between the current date and January 1st of the upcoming year.

It updates the displayed days, hours, minutes, and seconds every second.

When the countdown reaches zero, it seamlessly updates to start counting down to the next year.

The spinner is shown briefly for a smooth user experience.
